# Question to activity - A Moodle Question Bank Plugin

## Description
Question to activity (qtoactivity) is a plugin for the Moodle LMS that extends the functionality of the question bank question management page.
This plugin adds the option for users to select individual or multiple questions and add them right to an activity of their choosing, without having to access that individual activities management page.

## Project information
This project was initially started as part of a student project collaboration with Catalyst IT Australia and University of New England.
The main goal of this project was to help students prepare for the industry by having a mentor from the host company, coming up with a project idea
and finally create an mvp of the idea using industry approach and methodologies. This project was a huge success where all the students were able to
learn and develop an mvp of the qbank plugin and showcase their work to the university.

Team members from University of new England:

- Henry Campbell - hcampb25@myune.edu.au
- Luke Purnell - lpurnell@myune.edu.au
- Harrison Liddell - hliddell@myune.edu.au

## Project enhancement
The initial product was done in a short timeframe and proved that the idea is possible and students gained a real experience of the industry.
To make this project usable and available to the community, a lot of work needed to be done on top of the great work from the students.
The current phase took advantage of the initial development, polished the code and changed it to allow a better future and follow the proper
moodle way of doing plugins.
